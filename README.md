I worked on a previous website that shows a modal with a gif when a button is pressed. I enhanced my code by adding a keydown event that closes the modal when the Esc key is pressed.

After programming your keydown event, I streamlined my code by creating a new function expression that closes the modal and then calling that function in my event handlers.
